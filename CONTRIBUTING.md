## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, and to accept pull requests.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
